# Problems:

Users view and order food from menu. Framer Motion is used to provide animation and better UI experience.

# What I learned:

Implementing different effects/animations of Framer Motion.
Manage React states and Hooks to control data flow in the app.
Working with colors and patterns to create warm atmosphere for the app.

# Reflex:

this project helps me to practice my skill with Materialize CSS, React Hooks, and Framer Motion.
I also learn how to work with SVG and doing basic animation with SVG through Framer Motion.
